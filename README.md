# ADM_hw1
First homework of the course "Algorithmic methods of Data Mining"

### 1.`HW1.py`
It contains the code of all the HackerRanck exercises

### 2. `adm_hw1_pdf_merged.pdf`
It's the pdf that contains the screenshots of all the HackerRanck submissions.



##### N.b.: I used to code in Java and C, so this was my first time using Python and for this reason I consulted a lot the official Python documentation. For some Python features, such as list comprehension and decorators, I also read the explanations from some more "didactic" websites like w3school.
Regarding the Regex module, it's the only one for which I tried to see also the HackerRank tutorials / Stackoverflow, but I wasn't able to do the exercises anyway.
